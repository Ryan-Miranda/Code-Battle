# CodeBattle #
CodeBattle is (currently) a one-on-one coding challenge game. The objective is to accurately complete the challenge described by a prompt's criteria before one's opponent does. Users are able to type and submit code whose output is compared against various test cases; each player codes as fast as they can until one of them successfully solves the problem.

Ever had an argument with a friend about who the better coder is? Now there's a way to settle it once and for all! Leave it up to CodeBattle challenges to decide it all!
